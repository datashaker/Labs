## Restoration of functional dependencies
The purpose of solving the problem is to restore the target functions in an additive/multiplicative form by a discrete sample.
### Simplified 
Given data:
- Set X1 (internal parameters)
- Set X2 (controlled external parameters)
- Set X3 (uncontrolled external parameters)
- Quantity and weights of target functions
  
Find: 
- Target variable dependency structure  ![f1]
